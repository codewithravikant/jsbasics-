/*Basic JavaScript: Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
*/

var sum = 10 + 0;
var sum = 10 + 10;
/*
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.


*/

var difference = 45 - 33;
/*
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169
Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

*/
var product = 8 * 10;
/*
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8
Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

*/
var quotient = 66 /33;

/*
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
*/
var myVar = 87;
// Only change code below this line
myVar++;


/*
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;

is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.

*/

var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

/*
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).


*/
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 6.7;

/*
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.

*/
var product = 2.0 * 0.0;
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;


/*
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.


*/
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line


/*


The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.


*/
var remainder = 11 % 3;
