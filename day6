/*Basic JavaScript: Return Early Pattern for Functions
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example

function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();
The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.

Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.

Hint
Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.
*/
// Setup
function abTest(a, b) {
  // Only change code below this line
if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
  return undefined;
}

  // Only change code above this line

  return Math.round(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(a) + Math.sqrt(b), 2));
}

abTest(2,2);

/*
Basic JavaScript: Counting Cards
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Output
-3 Hold
5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.


switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }
  if (count > 0) {
    return count + " Bet";
  } else {
    return count + " Hold";
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}

cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');

*/
var regex = /[JQKA]/;
  if (card > 1 && card < 7) {
    count++;
  } else if (card === 10 || regex.test(card)) {
    count--;
  }

  if (count > 0) return count + " Bet";
  return count + " Hold";

// answer 2

 switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }
  if (count > 0) {
    return count + " Bet";
  } else {
    return count + " Hold";
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}

cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');


/*
 Basic JavaScript: Build JavaScript Objects
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". However,
 you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

var anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs",
"tails" and "friends".

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as "name" is a string,
 "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.


*/
var myDog = {
// Only change code below this line
"name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Water", "Cat"]

// Only change code above this line
};

/*
Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.


*/
// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line

/*
Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.


*/
// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line

/*
Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
 This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
var myDog = "Hunter";
var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected
dynamically during the program execution, as follows:

var someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  var s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access
the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player.
*/
// Setup
var testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line

var playerNumber = 16;       // Change this line
var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line
